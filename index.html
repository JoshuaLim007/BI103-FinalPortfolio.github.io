    <p>In each chapter there will be at least two examples of my mastery of the course outcome. It can contain but not limited to quiz answers, previous assignments and medias, data collections, pictures and drawings. Along with the example there will be
        further explanations if it is needed. </p>
    <p>Since I am a CS major, building a website is good way to practice programming and biology. I would most likely come back to this website when showing my projects to recruiters and even help me remember my biology lessons along the way</p>

                    SCIENCE CONCEPTS
                </h1>
                <p>In this section I will be giving the defnition of biology and an example of a thoery related to biology. These will demonstrate my mastery of science concepts because I understand what biology is and theories related to biology.</p>
                <h2>What is Biology?</h2>
                <p>Biology is the study of living organisms, divided into many specialized fields including anatomy, and behavior. </p>
                <h2>1 example of a biology thoery</h2>
                <p>Endosymbiotic theory is that the origins of mitochondria were a bacteria that survived by living in another single celled organism. They eventually merged into one object becoming the mitochondria we have in our cells today.</p>

                    In this section I will be showing my notes from 1A and discuss my studying strategies.
                    This will demonstrate my mastery with science skills because taking notes and studying strategies are vital for success, especially for science.
                </p>

                <h2>Study Strategy</h2>
                <p>
                    My best strategy for studying is to take notes and listen carefully without distractions during lectures or in this class videos;
                    this is when most of my studying happens. I like to be efficient.
                    I also go over the notes I have taken to make sure I have the notes for the target goals in each module.

                    I will be showing one of my medias on ethics. By sharing my media on 8A Ethics, I demostrate my knowledge on ethical issues with science. 
                    I will also share one my favorite science experiences to demonstrate that my past had connections to science.

                <p>
                    Here I will be sharing answers to two different quiz questios on the life stages of a cell and muscular system.
                    These answers will demonstrate my ability to recall general biology concepts.
                </p>
                <h2>Question 1:</h2>
                <p>Tell a cell's life story, including four different processes (life stages) that occur to that cell over time.  You can be creative as long as you include the stages discussed in Guide A, section 4.</p>
                <p>A cell undergoes mitosis, where one cell divides and becomes two daughter cells. Then the cell grows in size over time, hypertrophy. Then each cell goes through differentiation, where a cell changes its structure and function over time. After some time the cells dies which is known as apoptosis. </p>
                <h2>Question 2:</h2>
                <p>Muscles have a unique structure that is often referred to as “bundles within bundles.”  Describe what the bundles are to someone who cannot visualize them; starting from the largest (fascicle) to the smallest (myofilament); including appearance and function.</p>
                <p>Bundles within bundles mean that the muscles are made up of many fascicles that are made up of many myocytes that are made up of many myofibrils that are made up of many myofilaments. Each structure are made up of something smaller. That is why it's called bundles within bundles. </p>
                <p>Fascicles are stringy connective tissue. Myocytes are also stringy along with myofibrils and filaments. Myofilaments move very little, but with many of these, it can add up to a large contraction.</p>

                    Here I will be showing my data visualization of the body data I have been tracking for 10+ weeks.
                    I will also share the mini stress experiement done in media 7A.
                    These will demonstrate my ability to conduct experiements and measure reasonable and accurate data.

                    Here I will be listing 3 reasons why aerobic exercises on respiratory organs.
                    I will also be sharing an optimal food balance.
                    These will demonstrate my ability to apply biology knowledge to every day lives.
                </p>

                <h2>Three positive impacts of aerobic exercise:</h2>

                <p> 1. Increases muscle strength of respiratory organs.</p>
                    
                <p>  2. Fresh air space and tidal volume within the lungs.</p>
                    
                <p>  3. Increases the amount of oxygen for cells.</p>

                <embed src="Resources/MyPyramid.svg" style="width:80%;height:80%;"/>
                <p>Grains is the largest (orange). 
                    Vegetable is the second largest (Green). 
                    Milk and Dairy is the third largest (Blue).
                    Fruit is the fourth (Red).
                    Meat and beans are second smallest (Purple).
                    Oil is the smallest (Yellow).
                    Exercising is also part the pyramid.
                </p>
                <p>The food pyramid demonstrates the proportions that give sufficient nutrients
                    and to minimize the potential to consume excess calories.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The pyramid also establishes variety to 
                    maximize to different nutrients.

                    I will be explaining various non-infectious diseases in humans.
                    These explanation will demonstrate my knowledge on diseaes related to the human biology.
                </p>

                <h2>Types of Diabetes:</h2>
                <p>Type 1: Insulin dependent, juvenile onset, beta cells are not producing enough insulin, often related to genetics.</p>
                <p>Type 2: Not insulin dependent, adult onset, 
                    pancreas produces enough insulin but 
                    cells don't have enough receptors to 
                    receive it. Age, overweight, 
                    lack of exercise, and history 
                    themselves can increase risks.</p>

                <p>Gestational: People are not making enough 
                    insulin or utilize them during pregnancy. 
                    Ages over 25 and high weight can increase risks.</p>
                
                <h2>Cancers: </h2>
                <p>
                    For cancer to appear, a cell must undergo a series of mutations to the DNA. 
                    This occurs during mitosis or exposure to
                     mutagens such as UV radiation. These mutations
                      must occur in the proto oncogenes region of the DNA,
                       causing the cell not to undergo apoptosis. 
                       The cell then will undergo rapid growth creating a tumor. 
                       If the cancer cells masterized, 
                       then we will call that a stage 4 cancer. 
                       Otherwise it will be a stage 2 and 3 for larger tumors and 
                       stage 1 for small tumors. 
                </p>
